        ## 1. User-Provided Information:

        - **Website URL:** {url}
        - **Brand/Company Name:** {brand_name}
        - **Primary Target Audience:** {audience}
        - **Top 3 Competitors:** {competitors}

        ## 2. Audit Structure & Execution:
        Please structure your response as a formal audit report using Markdown for clear formatting. Follow these sections precisely:

        ### Executive Summary
        Begin with a high-level overview. Summarize the website's current digital marketing health. Concisely list the top 3 most significant strengths and the top 3 most critical areas for immediate improvement.

        ### Section A: On-Page & Content Analysis
        - **Top Performing Pages:** Based on likely organic traffic and keyword value, identify 3-5 pages that are probably the strongest assets.
        - **Content Quality & E-E-A-T:** Assess the website's content for signals of Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T).
        - **On-Page SEO Elements:** Analyze Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, Header Tags, Internal Linking, and Calls-to-Action (CTAs).

        ### Section B: Keyword & Ranking Analysis
        - **Current Keyword Footprint:** Identify 10-15 commercially important, non-branded keywords the site likely ranks for. Present this in a table with columns: Keyword, Estimated Monthly Search Volume, Estimated Ranking Position, and Ranking URL.
        - **"Striking Distance" Keywords:** Identify 5-7 keywords where the site is likely ranking on page 2 (positions 11-20).
        - **Keyword Gap Analysis:** Identify 3-5 valuable keywords that competitors rank for, but the target website does not.

        ### Section C: Technical SEO Audit
        - **Indexability & Crawlability:** Review robots.txt and XML sitemap presence.
        - **Website Speed & Core Web Vitals:** Analyze LCP, CLS, and INP.
        - **Mobile-Friendliness:** Assess mobile responsiveness.
        - **Site Architecture & URL Structure:** Evaluate URL clarity.
        - **Security:** Confirm HTTPS usage.

        ### Section D: Structured Data (Schema Markup) Analysis
        - **Implementation Check:** Determine if structured data is used.
        - **Types of Schema:** Identify schema types used (e.g., Organization, LocalBusiness).
        - **Opportunities:** Suggest 2-3 new schema types to implement.

        ### Section E: Off-Page & Brand Visibility Audit
        - **Backlink Profile Overview:** Provide a conceptual overview of the domain's authority and link quality.
        - **Brand Mentions:** Analyze brand visibility and unlinked mentions.
        - **Google Business Profile:** Assess its completeness and optimization.
        - **Social Media Presence:** List active profiles and comment on activity.

        ### Section F: Prioritized Actionable Recommendations
        Conclude with a prioritized list of the top 5 most impactful recommendations using the "What, Why, How" framework:
        - **What:** The specific action to take.
        - **Why:** The business or SEO impact.
        - **How:** A high-level summary of implementation.

        Maintain a professional, consultative tone throughout the report.
