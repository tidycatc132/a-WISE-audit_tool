### Executive Summary
Begin with a high-level overview. Summarize the website's current digital marketing health. Concisely list the top 3 most significant strengths and the top 3 most critical areas for immediate improvement.

### Section A: On-Page & Content Analysis
- **Top Performing Pages:** Based on likely organic traffic and keyword value, identify 3-5 pages that are probably the strongest assets.
- **Content Quality & E-E-A-T:** Assess the website's content. Analyze for signals of Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). Is the content well-researched, in-depth, and user-focused? Are there author bios?
- **On-Page SEO Elements:** Analyze the use and optimization of:
- Title Tags & Meta Descriptions (Are they compelling and keyword-rich?)
- Header Tags (h1, h2, etc. - Is there a logical hierarchy?)
- Internal Linking (Is there a strong internal linking strategy to pass authority and help users navigate?)
- URL Structure (Does the website use topic clusters?)
- Word Count (What is the average word count of the pages on the website?)
- New Content (Is new content added to the website? If so what is the date of the most recently published page?)

### Section B: Keyword & Ranking Analysis
- **Current Keyword Footprint:** Identify a list of 10-15 commercially important, non-branded keywords the site likely ranks for. Present this in a table with columns: Keyword, Estimated Monthly Search Volume, Estimated Ranking Position, and Ranking URL.
- **"Striking Distance" Keywords:** Identify 5-7 keywords where the site is likely ranking on page 2 (positions 11-20), representing significant opportunities.
- **Keyword Gap Analysis:** Briefly compare the brand's likely keyword profile to the provided competitors. Identify 3-5 valuable keywords that competitors rank for, but the target website does not.

### Section C: Technical SEO Audit
- **Indexability & Crawlability:** Review the likely status of robots.txt and the presence of an XML sitemap. Are there any potential issues preventing search engines from accessing content?
- **Website Speed & Core Web Vitals:** Provide an analysis of the site's likely performance regarding Google's Core Web Vitals (Largest Contentful Paint - LCP, Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS, Interaction to Next Paint - INP).
- **Mobile-Friendliness:** Assess the website's mobile responsiveness and user experience.
- **Site Architecture & URL Structure:** Are the URLs clean, logical, and user-friendly (e.g., example.com/services/seo-audit vs. example.com/p?id=123)?
- **Security:** Confirm if the site uses HTTPS.

### Section D: Structured Data (Schema Markup) Analysis
- **Implementation Check:** Determine if structured data is used on the website.
- **Types of Schema:** If present, identify the types of schema being used (e.g., Organization, LocalBusiness, Product, Article, FAQPage).
- **Opportunities:** Suggest 2-3 new schema types that could be implemented to enhance search visibility.

### Section E: Off-Page & Brand Visibility Audit
- **Backlink Profile Overview:** Provide a conceptual overview of the backlink profile. Estimate the domain's authority (mentioning concepts like Domain Authority or Domain Rating). Are the links likely from high-quality, relevant sources?
- **Brand Mentions:** Analyze the brand's overall visibility across the web. Are there mentions on industry blogs, news sites, or forums? Are these mentions linked?
- **Google Business Profile:** Search for the brand's Google Business Profile (if applicable for a local business). Assess its likely completeness (photos, reviews, accurate information).
- **Social Media Presence:** Briefly list the active social media profiles associated with the brand and comment on their apparent activity level.

### Section F: Prioritized Actionable Recommendations
Conclude the audit with a prioritized list of the top 8 most impactful recommendations. For each recommendation, use the following "What, Why, How" framework:

- **What:** The specific action to take.
- **Why:** The business or SEO impact this action will have.
- **How:** A brief, high-level summary of how to implement the change.

Maintain a professional, consultative tone throughout the report.
